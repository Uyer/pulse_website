          <p class>Having discovered the piano and electronic music at his early youth thanks to his family, he grew up intensely
            interested in music. Being just a teenager he started to walk around every dance floor of his hometown (Rosario,
            where he was born and raised) and by the late 90's he started to mix records at a local pub. Over the next decade,
            he became a key player into the south american scene being booked for major events such as Time Warp (Argentina)
            and Creamfields (Argentina, Brasil, Peru). Mariano also became a regular guest at the best regional clubs like
            Pacha, State (Buenos Aires), Warung, D-Edge (Brasil), La Feria (Chile).  His sets, characterized by a deep hypnotic
            flow and soft mixing skills also captivated dance floors over the world as Club Der Visionaere in Berlin or Womb
            in Japan.</p>

            After releasing an independient LP in 2009 and several works with friend's labels, he decided by 2012 to found
            one of his own, naming it GET SLOW. Years later he founded MICRA and also joined a project called LA MONTAÑA
            DISCOS with local friends.</p>
